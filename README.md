#### Senior Frontend Developer, Team Lead â€¢ JavaScript, Angular, TypeScript, UI/UX

I'm a Software engineer with over 15 years of experience and strong fundamentals in front-end technologies. Have a 9-year background in backend development.

I am well-versed in JavaScript and TypeScript, with professional experience working with Angular 15+ and React.js.

**Team lead**. Skilled in developer team management and know how to build and lead an inspired and performant team. Led 2 engineering teams with an average size of 7 members across two companies and mentored over 10 junior mentees.

Now I'm interested in growing as an Engineering manager and mentor. Want to build strong, collaborative teams of inspired people to make meaningful products that we can be proud of.

**Mentor**. I'm working with frontend developers from Intern to Middle level. Helping them to start and grow their career in IT.

Love straightforward UX and beautiful UI. It's not an issue for me to sketch out ideas in Figma to pitch to product managers and designers.

Also, I love to make projects done, inspire teams, beautiful and user-friendly interfaces, traveling, and cooking.
